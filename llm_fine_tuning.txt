🎯 What is Fine-tuning?
Fine-tuning is taking a pre-trained model (like GPT-2) and teaching it to be better at a specific task by training it on your custom data.
Think of it like this:

Pre-training: Teaching a student general knowledge (expensive, takes months)
Fine-tuning: Teaching that student a specific subject (cheaper, takes hours/days)


📋 Step-by-Step Fine-tuning Process:
Step 1: Choose a Base Model
pythonmodel_name = "gpt2"
What's happening:

You're selecting a pre-trained model that already knows language
GPT-2 has been trained on millions of web pages
It already understands grammar, facts, reasoning, etc.

Popular choices:

GPT-2 (124M params): Small, fast, good for learning
Mistral-7B (7B params): Powerful, production-ready
Llama-3-8B (8B params): Very high quality


Step 2: Load the Model and Tokenizer
pythontokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
What's happening:
Tokenizer:

Converts text → numbers (tokens) that the model understands
Example: "Hello world" → [15496, 995]
Like a dictionary between human language and model language

Model:

The actual neural network with billions of parameters
These parameters are numbers that define what the model "knows"
Loading downloads the model weights (~500MB for GPT-2)


Step 3: Configure LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
pythonlora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,                          # Rank
    lora_alpha=16,                # Scaling factor
    target_modules=["c_attn"],    # Which layers to modify
    lora_dropout=0.05,            # Regularization
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
)
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
What's happening:
Instead of updating ALL parameters (expensive!), LoRA:

Freezes the original model weights
Adds small adapter layers to specific parts
Only trains these tiny adapters (0.1-1% of parameters)

Analogy: Instead of rewriting an entire textbook, you just add sticky notes with extra info.
Key parameters explained:

r (rank): How big the adapter is (8-64 typical)

Lower = faster, less memory, might be less powerful
Higher = slower, more memory, more expressive


lora_alpha: Controls how much influence the adapters have
target_modules: Which parts of the model get adapters

Attention layers are most important
For GPT-2: c_attn (attention)
For Llama: q_proj, v_proj, k_proj, o_proj



Why LoRA?

Without LoRA: Train 124M parameters = 24GB memory
With LoRA: Train 300K parameters = 2GB memory
400x more memory efficient! 🚀


Step 4: Prepare Your Dataset
pythontraining_texts = [
    "Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that learns from data.",
    # ... more examples
]

dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"text": training_texts})
What's happening:

You're creating examples of the knowledge/style you want to teach
Each example shows the model what "good output" looks like

Dataset format matters:

Text completion: Just raw text (what we're doing)
Instruction tuning: Question → Answer pairs
Chat format: User message → Assistant response

Example instruction format:
python{
    "instruction": "What is AI?",
    "response": "AI is the simulation of human intelligence..."
}

Step 5: Tokenize the Dataset
pythondef tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(
        examples["text"], 
        truncation=True,           # Cut off if too long
        padding="max_length",      # Pad to same length
        max_length=128             # Max tokens per example
    )

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
```

**What's happening:**
1. **Convert text to token IDs**
   - "Hello world" → `[15496, 995]`
2. **Truncation**: If text is >128 tokens, cut it off
3. **Padding**: If text is <128 tokens, add padding tokens
4. **Why?** Models need all examples to be the same length for batch processing

**Before tokenization:**
```
"Artificial Intelligence is..."  (text)
```

**After tokenization:**
```
[8001, 9345, 318, ...]  (numbers the model can process)

Step 6: Set Training Arguments
pythontraining_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./gpt2-finetuned",
    num_train_epochs=10,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    learning_rate=2e-4,
    logging_steps=5,
    save_strategy="epoch"
)
What's happening:
num_train_epochs (10):

How many times to go through your entire dataset
1 epoch = see each example once
More epochs = model learns better (but can overfit)

per_device_train_batch_size (2):

How many examples to process at once
Larger batch = faster but uses more memory
Your M4 Pro can handle 2-4 for GPT-2

learning_rate (2e-4 = 0.0002):

How big each parameter update is
Too high = model goes crazy, doesn't learn
Too low = training takes forever
1e-4 to 5e-4 is typical for fine-tuning

Analogy: Learning rate is like step size when hiking downhill. Too big = you overshoot the valley. Too small = takes forever.

Step 7: Create Data Collator
pythondata_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    mlm=False  # Causal LM (predict next token), not masked LM
)
What's happening:

Prepares batches of data for training
mlm=False means we're doing "predict the next word" (like GPT)
mlm=True would be "fill in the blank" (like BERT)

Example:

Input: "Artificial Intelligence is"
Target: "the simulation of human intelligence"


Step 8: Create Trainer and Train
pythontrainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset,
    data_collator=data_collator
)

trainer.train()
```

**What's happening during training:**

**For each epoch:**
1. **Forward pass**: Feed data through model, get predictions
2. **Calculate loss**: How wrong are the predictions?
3. **Backward pass**: Calculate gradients (which direction to adjust parameters)
4. **Update parameters**: Adjust LoRA adapters slightly
5. **Repeat** for all batches

**Visual of one training step:**
```
Input:  "AI is"
Target: "AI is the simulation"

Model predicts: "AI is a computer"  ❌
Loss: High (wrong prediction)

Adjust parameters to make "the simulation" more likely
Next time: "AI is the simulation"  ✅
Training metrics you'll see:

Loss: How wrong the model is (lower = better)
Steps: Number of batches processed
Epoch: Which full pass through data


Step 9: Save the Model
pythonmodel.save_pretrained("./gpt2-finetuned-final")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./gpt2-finetuned-final")
```

**What's happening:**
- Saves the LoRA adapter weights (small, ~10MB)
- Saves the tokenizer config
- **Doesn't** save the base model (you already have it)

**Files created:**
```
gpt2-finetuned-final/
├── adapter_config.json    # LoRA configuration
├── adapter_model.bin      # Your trained adapters (~10MB)
└── tokenizer files

Step 10: Use Your Fine-tuned Model
python# Load base model
base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Load your adapters on top
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "./gpt2-finetuned-final")

# Generate text
prompt = "Artificial Intelligence is"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
What's happening:

Load the original GPT-2 (unchanged)
Load your LoRA adapters on top
Now the model has learned your specific knowledge!
